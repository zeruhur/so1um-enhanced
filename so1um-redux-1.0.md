## Create your hero.

Roll 3d6 once each for **Body** (*physical prowess & health*), **Mind** (*mental capacity & intelligence*), **Spirit** (*spunk & willpower*). Even number are equal to one, sum them up. If you score zero, the stat equals 1. For Hit Points roll 2d6, count the evens and add this to Body score. Heroes begin with one cliché, roll 2d6 and gain another one cliché for each even number rolled. If you wish, determine a past, looks, quirks, etc.

## Determine goals & the first scene.

Figure out why your character is there and where they are in their story. This is a short description of where our hero is and what's happening. Imagine a starting point for your adventure. Are you *stealing space station plans? Are you plundering a tomb?*

## Begin asking questions.

To begin play, ask a question that has a **Yes** or **No** answer, it is important to keep it simple. Then consult the Oracle: roll 2d6 one white, the other black (or any different colors you like). If white is highstet the answer is **Yes**. If black is highest, the answer is **No**. If both are low (3 or less), add **But** to the answer. If both are high (4 or more), add **And**. **And** amplifies, while **But** mitigates. **No, And** means things went really bad. **No, But** softens the blow a bit. **Yes, But** is successful but with a drawback. **Yes, And** is all kinds of awesome.

If circumstances are different, include an additional die in favor of the more likely outcome when you roll, but only keep the higher die of that color when you compare.

If the dice are equal a **twist happens**.

* highest white die: Yes
* highest black die: No
* both 4+: And
* both 3-: No
* equal: twist

## Determine the twist.

Roll 2d6 and consult the following lists to determine what kind of twist. 

1st d6
1. NPC
2. PC
3. Organization
4. Physical event
5. Emotional event
6. Object

2nd d6
1. Appears
2. Alters the location
3. Helps the hero
4. Hinders the hero
5. Changes the goal
6. Ends the scene

Interpret the two-word sentence in the context of the current scene. Twists will keep the plot and events going in unexpected ways.

## Ask an open question or get inspired.

Sometimes a closed **Yes/No** question it won't be enough. To ask an open question, roll once each of the following lists (roll at least on verbs and nouns, adjective are optional).

## Determine the mood of the next scene.

Once the scene ends in some way (the protagonist's goal is met or failed) take a breath, and roll the next scene:

At the end of the current scene, you may need to determine the general mood of the next one. In this case roll 1d6 and consult the following:

* 1-3: Dramatic scene
* 4-5: Quiet Scene
* 6: Meanwhile…

A *dramatic scene* does not break the tension of the previous scene but carries it further forward, introducing further obstacles or difficulties.
During a *quiet scene* there is time to take a breath, to heal, to make plans for the next steps and to deepen relationships.
A *meanwhile scene* that takes place somewhere else than where the hero is. It cuts to villains or other plot-important characters.

## Contests.

When your character comes into dangerous or risky situations, determine Difficulty (either via narratory license or dice, *see below*). Use dice equal to Body, Mind, or Spirit for the contest, adding one die to the roll if a cliché is applicable. If *ONE* die rolls equal to the Difficulty or higher, you succeed!

1. *Automatic*  
2. *Simple*  
3. *Easy*  
4. *Average*  
5. *Tricky*  
6. *Hard*

## Scale up/down Difficulty.

Difficulty is situational and it is determined by events in the scene. There are cases in which, however, the difficulty could be different from that expected. Roll 2d6: if both are even, Diffulty scale up of one position, if both are odd Diffulty scale down, else Difficulty is as expected.

## Resolving Combat.

Combats are like a contests, but instead of rolling against a fixed difficulty, the opponents roll against each other. Each side rolls dice equal to applicable stats (adding one die if a cliché applies) and then compare results. The **HIGH** roll wins. If the die rolls are tie, the attack is a draw and no damage is caused.

## Taking/Causing/Healing Damage.

If you succeed at a combat check, subtract one HP from the enemy. When taking damage, you may reduce the Body score instead of HP. Any subsequent Body contests use the current score. When Body or HP reach zero, death occurs. Heal HP at a rate one per eight hours of rest, one Body at a rate of one per day.

## Gear and Loot

When you use a piece of gear intended to perform a particular task, you may reroll one die once. Dice are then compared again to determine the outcome of the contest. Characters can only benefit from one piece of gear, weapon, or armor per check and are only allowed to reroll one die once per check. Note that in combat it is assumed all are properly armed/armored and this rule would not be applicable.
