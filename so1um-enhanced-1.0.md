## Introduction
When I started getting interested in RPGs again, years after a bad burnout, I didn't have the opportunity to play in groups and therefore my attention was focused on solitaire systems.  
Of all the rules-light systems discovered on the net, so1um proved to be the one that best suited my taste and my conception of the game.  
It elegantly combines the mechanics of the classic D6 systems with the Risus clichés, guaranteeing the transversality that I have sought so much. It doesn't claim to be a full or crunchy system and that is its strong point.  
Matt Jackson version 0.6 is perfectly playable and complete on its own, but I have a soft spot for random prompt generation, being a creative with little imagination.  
In addition, the oracle, descendant of FU RPG, had been honed by Graven Utterance. I therefore decided to replace it and also to reintegrate some tools of Tiny Solitary Soldier, which so1um was inspired by in turn.  
So this version more than a revision is a collection of additional materials to support the poor of imagination like myself. I hope you may find it useful.

## Create Your Hero

Roll 3d6 once each for **Body** (*physical prowess & health*), **Mind** (*mental capacity & intelligence*), **Spirit** (*spunk & willpower*). Even numbers are equal to 1, odds are equal to 0, sum them up. If you score zero, the stat equals 1. For Hit Points roll 2d6, count the evens and add this to Body score. Heroes begin with one cliché, roll 2d6 and gain another one cliché for each even number rolled. 

## Flesh Out a Background

When playing alone, it can be helpful to start with the story to define your character's background in detail. The following table will help you with this task. Roll on each columnn or choose the one you prefer.

| D6 |     Archetype     |  Personality  |    Virtue    |    Flaw   |       Background       |
|:--:|:-----------------:|:-------------:|:------------:|:---------:|:----------------------:|
|  1 |    The Paragon    | Perfectionist |     Brave    | Bellicose |  Parental Abandonment  |
|  2 |     The Cynic     |     Helper    |   Generous   |   Gloomy  |     Retired Badass     |
|  3 |      The Fool     |     Seeker    |     Witty    |  Envious  |     Mysterious Past    |
|  4 |    The Idealist   |    Mediator   | Coscientious |    Mean   |  Career-Ending Injury  |
|  5 |   Lovable Rogue   |   Enthusiast  |   Temperate  |    Lazy   |     Had to Be Sharp    |
|  6 | Rebellious Spirit | Individualist |     Loyal    |    Rude   | Dark and Troubled Past |

## Appearance

This is entirely optional. If you need to determine the physical features of your hero, roll 1d6 on each column of the following table to determine appearance.

| D6 |    Build   |    Skin   |    Face   |   Hair   |  Speech  |   Clothing  |
|:--:|:----------:|:---------:|:---------:|:--------:|:--------:|:-----------:|
|  1 |  Athletic  |    Dark   | Elongated |   Bald   |   Blunt  |   Elegant   |
|  2 |    Short   |   Tanned  |    Soft   |   Long   |  Formal  |  Eccentric  |
|  3 |   Brawny   |   Rough   |   Round   |   Short  | Whispery | Fashionable |
|  4 | Statuesque |    Rosy   |   Square  |   Curly  |  Flowery |  Oversized  |
|  5 |    Stout   | Sunburned |   Sharp   |   Silky  |  Cryptic |  Undersized |
|  6 |   Scrawny  |    Pale   |   Broken  | Straight |   Slow   |   Foreign   |

## Determine Goals & The First Scene

Figure out why your character is there and where they are in their story. Imagine a starting point for your adventure. If none comes to mind, roll on each of the following questions to generate a random adventure seed.

| D6 |  Who?<br>The proposer   | What?<br>The mission | Why?<br>The incentive | Where?<br>The target |        How?<br>The seed       | Obstacle?<br>The complication |
|:--:|:-----------------------:|:--------------------:|:---------------------:|:--------------------:|:-----------------------------:|:-----------------------------:|
|  1 |        Authority        |        Rescue        |          Help         |        Person        |        Casual encounter       |           Opposition          |
|  2 |       Organization      |      Protection      |        Fortune        |         Group        |        Old acquaintance       |           Deception           |
|  3 | Ally (friend, relative) |        Exploit       |       Coercition      |       Treasure       |             Rumors            |          Environment          |
|  4 |          Mentor         |        Explore       |        Impulse        |       Location       |            Capture            |            Disguise           |
|  5 |       Help-seeker       |        Escape        |        Ambition       |       McGuffin       |             Mishap            |              Time             |
|  6 |       Blackmailer       |        Pursuit       |        Revenge        |      Confession      | Object (map, journal, letter) |             Space             |

## Begin asking questions.

To begin play, ask a question that has a **Yes** or **No** answer, it is important to keep it simple. Then consult the Oracle: roll 2d6 one white, the other black (or any different colors you like). If white is the highstet the answer is **Yes**. If black is the highest, the answer is **No**. If both are low (3 or less), add **But** to the answer. If both are high (4 or more), add **And**. **And** amplifies, while **But** mitigates. **No, And** means things went really bad. **No, But** softens the blow a bit. **Yes, But** is successful but with a drawback. **Yes, And** is all kinds of awesome.

If circumstances are different, include an additional die in favor of the more likely outcome when you roll, but only keep the higher die of that color when you compare.

If the dice are equal a **twist happens**.

Summing up:
* White die is the highest: **Yes**
* Black die is the highest: **No**
* Both dice are 4+: **...And**
* Both dice are 3-: **...But**
* Both dice are equal: **Twist!**

## Determine the Twist

Roll 2d6 and consult the following lists to determine what kind of twist. 

| D6 |      Subject       |        Action       |
|:--:|:------------------:|:-------------------:|
|  1 |    A third party   |       Appears       |
|  2 |      The hero      | Alters the location |
|  3 |    An encounter    |    Helps the hero   |
|  4 |  A physical event  |   Hinders the hero  |
|  5 | An emotional event |   Changes the goal  |
|  6 |      An object     |    Ends the scene   |

Interpret the two-word sentence in the context of the current scene. Twists will keep the plot and events going in unexpected ways.

## Ask an Open Question or Get Inspired

Sometimes a closed **Yes/No** question it won't be enough. To answer an open question, roll 1d6 once on each of the following tables (at least verbs and nouns, adjectives are optional).

| Verbs |     1    |    2   |    3    |     4    |    5    |    6    |
|:-----:|:--------:|:------:|:-------:|:--------:|:-------:|:-------:|
|   1   |  inject  |  pass  |   own   |  divide  |   bury  |  borrow |
|   2   | continue |  learn |   ask   | multiply | receive | imagine |
|   3   |  develop | behave | replace |  damage  | collect |   turn  |
|   4   |   share  |  hand  |   play  |  explain | improve |  cough  |
|   5   |   face   | expand |  found  |  gather  |  prefer |  belong |
|   6   |   trip   |  want  |   miss  |    dry   |  employ | destroy |

| Nouns |      1     |    2    |    3   |    4   |     5     |     6    |
|:-----:|:----------:|:-------:|:------:|:------:|:---------:|:--------:|
|   1   |    cause   |  stage  | change |  verse |   thrill  |   spot   |
|   2   |    front   |  event  |  home  |   bag  |  measure  |   birth  |
|   3   |    prose   |  motion |  trade | memory |   chance  |   drop   |
|   4   | instrument |  friend |  talk  | liquid |    fact   |   price  |
|   5   |    word    | morning |  edge  |  room  |   system  |   camp   |
|   6   |     key    |  income |   use  |  humor | statement | argument |

| Adjectives |      1      |       2       |     3     |       4       |      5      |     6     |
|:----------:|:-----------:|:-------------:|:---------:|:-------------:|:-----------:|:---------:|
|      1     |   frequent  |     faulty    |  obscene  |     scarce    |    rigid    | long-term |
|      2     |   ethereal  | sophisticated |  rightful | knowledgeable | astonishing |  ordinary |
|      3     | descriptive |   insidious   |    poor   |     proud     |  reflective |  amusing  |
|      4     |    silky    |   worthless   |   fixed   |     loose     |   willing   |    cold   |
|      5     |    quiet    |     stormy    |   spooky  |   delirious   |    innate   |    late   |
|      6     | magnificent |    arrogant   | unhealthy |    enormous   |  truculent  |  charming |

## Determine the mood of the next scene

At the end of the current scene, you may need to determine the general mood of the next one. In this case roll 1d6 and consult the following table:

|  D6 |   Next Scene   |
|:---:|:--------------:|
| 1-3 | Dramatic scene |
| 4-5 |   Quiet Scene  |
|  6  |   Meanwhile…   |

A **dramatic scene** does not break the tension of the previous scene but carries it further forward, introducing further obstacles or difficulties.
During a **quiet scene** there is time to take a breath, to heal, to make plans for the next steps and to deepen relationships.
A **meanwhile scene** that takes place somewhere else than where the hero is. It cuts to villains or other plot-important characters.

## Contests

When your character comes into dangerous or risky situations, determine Difficulty (either via narratory license or dice, *see below*). Use dice equal to Body, Mind, or Spirit for the contest, adding one die to the roll if a cliché is applicable. If *ONE* die rolls equal to the Difficulty or higher, you succeed!

| D6 | Difficulty |
|:--:|:----------:|
|  1 |  Automatic |
|  2 |   Simple   |
|  3 |    Easy    |
|  4 |   Average  |
|  5 |   Tricky   |
|  6 |    Hard    |

## Scale Up/Down Difficulty

Difficulty is situational and it is determined by events in the scene. There are cases in which, however, the difficulty could be different from that expected. Roll 2d6: if both are even, Diffulty scale up of one position, if both are odd Diffulty scale down, else Difficulty is as expected.

## Resolving Combat

Combats are like a contests, but instead of rolling against a fixed difficulty, the opponents roll against each other. Each side rolls dice equal to applicable stats (adding one die if a cliché applies) and then compare results. The **HIGH** roll wins. If the die rolls are tie, the attack is a draw and no damage is caused.

## Taking/Causing/Healing Damage

If you succeed at a combat check, subtract one HP from the enemy. When taking damage, you may reduce the Body score instead of HP. Any subsequent Body contests use the current score. When Body or HP reach zero, death occurs. Heal HP at a rate one per eight hours of rest, one Body at a rate of one per day.

## Gear and Loot

When you use a piece of gear intended to perform a particular task, you may reroll one die once. Dice are then compared again to determine the outcome of the contest. Characters can only benefit from one piece of gear, weapon, or armor per check and are only allowed to reroll one die once per check. Note that in combat it is assumed all are properly armed/armored and this rule would not be applicable.

## How to find Good Clichés

Clichés are tropes that define your hero. They depend primarily on the setting you use. But the reverse is also true: a cliché can suggest a lot about the game's setting if you don't have ideas on how to get started.

A good way to create a character in the absence of inspiration is to rely on random lists (like the Big List of Cliché below), or the random generator (like the one on TV Tropes). Either way randomly generate until a cliché clicks in your mind. At this point the character (and perhaps the setting) has taken shape.

Obviously no one forces you to randomly generate anything (as well as the other generation tables above are only designed as aids in case your mind is "stuck").

A cliché should summarize your character's iconic characteristics such as their profession, their skills, their background and any information that has to do with their past and even their desires and any moral and personal affiliations.


### The Big List of Clichés
The following list comes to the aid of uninspired players. It contains a selection of classic stock characters that you can use verbatim or to unlock your creativity.

## Non-player characters
Non-player characters follow the same creation rules as heroes, making use of more appropriate clichés, depending on the kind of foe, which can range from the same as the heroes to the classic villain clichés (like *Evil Overlord*, *Mad Scientist*, *Mastermind*, etc.).
